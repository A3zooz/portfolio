The German University in Cairo New Cairo, Egypt

- Led a team of 5 developers in the design and implementation of Python-based scheduling algorithms.
- Cut defense scheduling time from2 weeks to 5 hoursvia Genetic Algorithm to schedule600 students’
    thesis.
- Designed and implemented efficient algorithms to schedule bachelor defense sessions, optimizing for faculty
    availability and minimizing conflicts.
- Developed robust Python logic to handle dynamic input constraints (e.g., time slots, examiner assignments,
    student preferences).
- Conducted team planning and review sessions to align technical solutions with project requirements.
- Conducted extensive testing and debugging to verify algorithm accuracy and reliability under real-world scenar-
    ios.

PROJECTS

Course Website for Canadian Chamber of Commerce (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)


- Collaborated in a team of 4 on the development of a MERN stack(MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)
    web application enabling users to attend pre-recorded courses online.
- Implemented features for course progress tracking, issuing of certificates after finishing a course.
- Contributed to responsive UI design using React and CSS for an enhanced user experience.
- Worked within a team to deliver project milestones and improve functionality based on stakeholders’ feedback.

Task Manager CRUD App (Spring Boot, Docker, PostgreSQL, Spring JPA)

- Developed a simple Task Manager web application using Java and Spring Boot.
- Implemented RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on tasks, including add, update, delete, and fetch.
- Integrated PostgreSQL as the backend database with JPA for data persistence.
- Used Docker and Docker Compose to containerize the application and database for easy deployment.

Turn-Based City Conquering Game (Java, Java Swing)

- Developed and maintained a Java-based, turn-based strategy game, implementing core mechanics such as city
    management, army recruitment, and world conquest.
- Applied object-oriented design principles to model complex entities like players, cities, armies, and units with
    robust class hierarchies.
- Implemented game logic for resource management, building construction, upgrades, and combat, including
    custom exception handling to enforce gameplay rules.
- Executed comprehensive unit testing to validate functionalities such as recruitment, attack mechanics, city
    conquest, and end-turn logic.
- Collaborated in building scalable code for army movement, siege mechanics, ensuring balanced gameplay and
    clean error management.

Compiler Simulation (Java)

- Developed and maintained a Java project focused on compiler construction concepts, including regular expres-
    sions, finite automata, and context-free grammars.
- Implemented algorithms for converting regular expressions to NFAs, NFAs to DFAs, and performed grammar
    transformations such as epsilon, unit, and left recursion elimination.
- Built and tested modules for computing FIRST and FOLLOW sets, and designed an LL(1) parser for context-free
    grammars.

SpokenHabit (Supabase/PostgreSQL, React Native, Expo, Expo Router)

- Built a cross-platform voice-powered habit tracker using React Native, Expo Router, and Supabase, enabling
    hands-free habit and task management.
- Integrated real-time synchronization and authentication with Supabase, supporting secure, multi-device usage
    and instant updates.
- Implemented AI-driven voice command parsing via Groq and Supabase Edge Functions, allowing users to add
    and complete habits/tasks by speaking.

AICalender (React, Express.js, Together.ai)

- Built a project that utilizesGenerative AIto efficiently schedule tutors’ timeslots using Together.ai, React,
    Express.js.
- Designed and implemented an intuitive UI for tutors to create and view schedules, featuring dynamic forms and
    interactive calendar views.
